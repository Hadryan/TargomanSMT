Here is a brief guide on how to build Targoman SMTCore, tools and associated
libraries.

1 - Unpack.  This should give a top-level directory with the subdirectories
    listed in README, as well as a few documentation files and a buildAndTest
    script. For an overview of Targoman, see the documentation in Docs folder.

2 - You need Qt v5.3 and above
